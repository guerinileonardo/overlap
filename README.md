# Quasiprobabilistic state-overlap estimator for NISQ devices

Code to accompany the article **[Quasiprobabilistic state-overlap estimator for NISQ devices](www.arxiv.org/abs/XXXXX)**, by Leonardo Guerini, Roeland Wiersema, Juan Felipe Carrasquilla, and Leandro Aolita.

All code is written in Python. Here is a short summary of them:
* .[scaling].(link): calculates the sample complexity scaling of our method according to the number of qubits;
* .[IST_comparison].(link): compares the performance of our method with the Improved Swap Test circuit, simulated with the LPDO paradigm within NISQ assumptions;
* .[Bell-basis_comparison].(link): compares the performance of our method with the Bell-basis circuit, simulated with the LPDO paradigm within NISQ assumptions;
* .[direct_app_comparison].(link): compares the performance of our method with the direct overlap estimator presented by Elben et. al.
